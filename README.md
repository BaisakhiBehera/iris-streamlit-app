# 🌸 Iris Flower Species Predictor – Powered by Machine Learning 🌿

Welcome to the **Iris Flower Predictor App**!  
This web app uses a Logistic Regression model to predict the species of an Iris flower based on user-provided measurements.

## 🚀 Built With

- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Streamlit**
- **Numpy**
- **Pickle**

---

## 📊 Dataset

The app is trained using the classic **Iris Dataset**, which contains 150 rows and 4 features:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

Target species:

- *Iris-setosa* 🌸  
- *Iris-versicolor* 🌿  
- *Iris-virginica* 🌺

## 🧠 How It Works

1. A Logistic Regression model is trained using the Iris dataset.
2. The model is serialized and saved as a `.pkl` file using `pickle`.
3. A user-friendly web app is created using Streamlit.
4. Users interact with sliders to provide flower measurements.
5. The model predicts and displays the Iris species.
